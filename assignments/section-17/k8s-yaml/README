ensure you have docker and kubernetes running (docker desktop)
ensure your PWD(present working directory) contains the app.yml file "assignments/section-17/k8s-yaml/"
use the command "kubectl apply -f app.yml"
congrats, everything is working. You can explore with further commands such as
kubectl get all
kubectl describe <POD/NAME>
kubectl logs <DEPLOYMENT/NAME>
