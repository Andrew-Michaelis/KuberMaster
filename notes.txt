Why Docker?:
  Isolation
    - old servers kept apps all over the place spread across machines, causing regular problems, but then came...
    - Virtual Machines: VM's
      allowed servers to be spun up on demand, accessability became a problem as even simple programs contained uneccesary chaff
  Environment
    - programming for multiple environments bleeds complexity.
    - the "Matrix from Hell" represents every part of your app interacting with every user.
    - Containers: an abstract representing the "MfH"
  Speed (of change)
    - discussing the speed of business, not anything to do with hardware or software
    - Containers are the next step in computing that allow faster; development, building, testing, and deploying

The 3 step Docker workflow:
  build
    - Dockerfile: OCI image standard
    - universal package manager
    Image layers
      python bins+libs
      flask
      app
  ship
    - Docker Registry: OCI distribution spec
    - universal app distribution
    - Built image has a unique SHA hash, this allows it to be shared
      push image (docker push)
      pull image (docker pull)
  run
    runs Docker to pull an image
    - Linux/Win Server: self contained machine
    - IMAGE:
      creates and runs container(s) containing your app
      allows mass hosting of the same page.

Running containers:
  3 major ways to run containers
    - Locally: (Docker Desktop, RD)
    - Server: (Docker Engine, K8s)
    - PaaS: (Cloud Run, Fargate)
